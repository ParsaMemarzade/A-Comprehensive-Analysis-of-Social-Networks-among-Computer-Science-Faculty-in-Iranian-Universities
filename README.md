# A Comprehensive Analysis of Social Networks among Computer Science Faculty in Iranian Universities

It's my bachelor's project under the supervision of Dr. Parham Moradi. 
My purpose at first was to mine all data from the Google Scholar pages of each professor which it can be used for any link of any one.
then by the fields of each one, I found relations between them.




## Mined data

### At first add link(s) to link.csv files
- Full name (infoData.csv)
- Job position (infoData.csv)
- Research interest(Fields) (infoData.csv)
- The chart of citations per year (infoData.csv)
- All information about citations (infoData.csv)
- All information about all articles (infoArticles.csv)




## Fields vector

Here by collected data(fields), if a prof has any of all fields it will be 1 if not it will be 0. (FieldsVector.csv)




## Profs Similarity

Here by fileds vector, the similarity between each profs has been found(ProfSimilarity.csv)



## Similarity Graph

Here by profs similarity, two graphs (circular and spring) are drawn. (Graph_spring.pdf) (Graph_circular.pdf)
